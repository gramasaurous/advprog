Copy all of the files in this directory into the student's
directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.  Numbers in
parens are the max points for each check.

Check to see if they are working alone or doing pair
programming.  If pair programming, they should have a symlink to
their partner's directory.  If it is not there, you should make
one.  Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

*****************************************************************

SOURCE CODE.

     Run mk.build

     (3) Checksource was silent, did not complain.  No extra
	 files were submitted, except as per asgt spec.
         C++ source are all called .h or .cc as appropriate.
         Indentation, formatting, and identifier names readable.

     (3) Fixed cix-client:main handling of args to properly
         check [host] [port] so that it works with only port

     (3) client get - code to parse command, make packet to
         send to server, and receive data reply.  Code to
         save file in current directory.

     (3) server get - responds to get request, ifstream to
         open file and load into buffer.  Send back in  a
         CIX_FILE packet

     (3) client put - code to open file, load into buffer,
         make CIX_PUT packet and send it, follow by payload
         containing file bytes.  Accept CIX_ACK or CIX_NAK

     (3) server put - code to accept CIX_PUT followed by payload
         open file and save.  Send back ACK or NAK

     (3) client rm - parse command and send header, receive
         reply.

     (3) server rm - accept packet call unlink(2), send back
         reply.

     (3) server ACK NAK check on any syscalls and send an ACK
         for success and a NAK with errno for fail.
         client:  print an OK message for an ACK and a 
         syserror message for a NAK.

     (3) common library code (cix_protocol) to load a file
         into a buffer or to write a buffer to a file.

PROGRAM TESTING:

     Run mk.build - if an executable was not built, assign 0
     points to this section.

     Note to grader:  You must be logged into unix.ucsc.edu
     using four separate xterms.  Use 'hostname' to verify
     that you have logged into the SAME machine, either
     unix1.lt.ucsc.edu or unix2.lt.ucsc.edu

     In one xterm, edit the SCORE file so you can record things
     that happen.

     Instructions for copying in .score are a little different:
     cp -R .score/* .
     that way the two subdirectories local and remote are
     copied into the student's directory.
     For each test, keep a typescript of the testing.

     daemon:
     in the daemon directory, cd remote:
     cp ../cix-daemon ../cix-server .
     Both programs must be copied to the daemon directory and
     make sure that . is in your path
     which cix-server
     will verify that it is.
     script daemon.log1
     cix-daemon 8888 (or whatever port works for you)

     in the client1 xterm: cd local1
     script client1.log1
     ../cix-client localhost 8888

     in the client2 xterm: cd local2
     script client2.log2
     ../cix-client localhost 8888

     That starts things, then move back and forth between each
     of the clients watching the daemon chatter.
     For the following, type in a command to see if it works.
     the prefix tells you which client to test.

     (4) client1: ls
         do you get the output?

     (4) client2: ls
         do you get the same output?

     (4) client1: put localfile
         client1: put localtto
         did the server respond?

     (4) client1: ls
         are the new files there?

     (4) client2: ls
         client2: get server1
         client2: exit
         did the file get transferred?

     (4) client2 (in local2)
         client2: get localfile
         client2: rm to-remove
         client2: rm server1
         does client2 now have client1's local file
         were the server files unlinked?
  
     (4) type "exit" to each client, then 
         ls -la to the bash shell
         exit will stop recording the typescript.
         after grading make sure you exit the typescript.
         were the script log files there and did the
         file transfers take effect as usual.

     (2) These are two free points if neither client nor
         server crashed.
