Notable changes:

cix-client.cpp:
In order to handle the case where a single argument is given to the
program I call get_cix_server_port() with the argument, and catch an 
invalid_argument which will be thrown by stoi() in case a non-integer
string was passed. If this is the case, I can assume that the argument
passed in is a server host, and not a port.
