Copy all of the files in this directory into the student's
directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.  Numbers in
parens are the max points for each check.

Check to see if they are working alone or doing pair
programming.  If pair programming, they should have a symlink to
their partner's directory.  If it is not there, you should make
one.  Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

SOURCE CODE.

     Run mk.build

     (3) Checksource was silent, did not complain.  No extra
	 files were submitted, except as per asgt spec.
         C++ source are all called .h or .cc as appropriate.
         Indentation, formatting, and identifier names readable.

     Properly implemented constructors for each of the shape
     classes, analyzing the arg list before making the object
     and calling the base class ctor when appropriate.
     Analysis done in the factory make_* functions.  (12 points)
     (1)  shape
     (1)     text
     (1)     ellipse
     (1)        circle
     (1)     polygon
     (1)        rectangle

     (1)           isosceles
     (1)           equilateral

     Graphics.

     Implemented drawing functions in shape.cpp and allowed
     others to inherit.  (6 points)
     (2) text::draw
     (2) ellipse::draw
     (2) polygon::draw
     Interactive functions once scene is drawn (9 points)
     (1) `Q', `q', Escape|Close the window.
     (1) `H', `h', Left Arrow|Move the selected object left.
     (1) `J', `j', Down Arrow|Move the selected object down.
     (1) `K', `k', Up Arrow|Move the selected object up.
     (1) `L', `l', Right Arrow|Move the selected object right.
     (1) `N', `n', Space, Tab|Set the selection to the next object.
     (1) `P', `p', Backspace|Set the selection to the previous object.
     (1) `0' ... `9'|Set the selection to objects 0 through 9
     (1) F1 ... F12|Set the slection to objects 1 through 12

PROGRAM TESTING:

     Run mk.build - if an executable was not built, assign 0
     points to this section.

     Note to grader:  You must be sitting in front of a workstation
     that is running an X11 client.  ssh -X will be necessary
     when logging into the server.

     Static display checking:

     Type the following commands in at the command line,
     and a 640x480 window should come up with the appropriate
     figures in it.  When you run the xwd command, a cursor
     cross will show up.  Move it to the student's window and
     click.  That will dump an image of the window into the
     output file.

     (4) gdraw ellipse-etc.gd
         xwd >ellipse-etc.gd.output

     (4) gdraw font-test.gd
         xwd >font-test.gd.output

     (4) gdraw movable.gd
         xwd >movable.gd.output

     (4) gdraw nested.gd
         xwd >nested.gd.output

     (4) gdraw rectilinear.gd
         xwd >rectilinear.gd.output

     Dynamic display checking:
     Test the interactive features on
          gdraw movable.gd
     (2) previous and next keys select objects, show border
     (2) arrow keys can move objects
     (2) digit keys and function keys can select objects
     (2) escape key exits the program.
     (2) border is shown around selected object

If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.
