CMPS 109 - Assignment 4:gdraw

Run make to compile the source. Run the program as follows:
 $ ./gdraw -h HEIGHT -w WIDTH path/to/inputfile
This will parse the input file for available commands, if successful,
will create a new gdraw window with width WIDTH and height HEIGHT (if
specified).

Available commands for input files are as follows from the asg spec:

   # '...'
      a comment line is ignored, as are empty lines and lines 
      consisting of only whitespace
   define 'name' text 'font' 'words ...'
      Create a text object with identifier 'name' and font 'font' from
      the available GLUT bitmap fonts:
         - Fixed-8x13
         - Fixed-9x15
         - Helvetica-10,12,18
         - Times-Roman-10,24  
      The text objects dispayed contents are defined as 'words...'
   define 'name' ellipse 'width' 'height'
      Create an ellpitical shape with base 'width', height 'height' and
      identifier 'name'.
   define 'name' circle 'diameter'
      Create a circle object with diameter and name.
   define 'name' polygon 'coordinates'
      Create a polygon object with name and coordinates specified.
      If odd number of coordinates are specified, an error is thrown.
      Vertices are normalized so their center is at (0,0) and then
      sorted in order of their angle with the x-axis to ensure that
      a convex and properly printed polygon.
