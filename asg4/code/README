CMPS 109 - Assignment 4:gdraw

Run make to compile the source. Run the program as follows:
 $ ./gdraw -h HEIGHT -w WIDTH path/to/inputfile
This will parse the input file for available commands, if successful,
will create a new gdraw window with width WIDTH and height HEIGHT (if
specified).

Available commands for input files and for keyboard input are as defined
in the assignment specification. Ambiguities and implementation options
not specified are documented here.

While defining any shape, if the number of required arguments is not as
specified, a runtime_error is thrown and an error message is printed.
For polygon, which can take a *infinite* (theoretically) number of
arguments, an error is thrown if the arguments cannot be evenly divided
into x-coordinates and y-coordinates. More on polygons: in order to 
correctly draw a polygon shape, and to try to be as user-friendly as
possible, the vertices given are normalized (as per the spec) so that 
they are concentric around (0,0). After this, they are sorted by their
angle with the x-axis. This ensures that OpenGL can easily draw each 
vertex in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner (and no weird things
will happen). This is done using the atan2(y, x) call from <cmath>.
