1.  Overview

In this assignment you will implement a simple graphics package using
the OpenGL graphics library.  Using inheritance, geometric objects
will be displayed in a window.  The lab workstations all run X11 so
there is no problem there.  When you log into the server remotely, be
sure to specify the -X option, as in:
   ssh -X username@unix.ucsc.edu
Before you log into the server make sure you have an X11 client
running on your own workstation.

2.  Program Specification

The program is presented in the form of a Unix man(1) page.

NAME
     gdraw -- drawing program displaying objects in a window

SYNOPSIS
     gdraw [ options] [filename]

OPTIONS
     All options are recognized by getopt(3).

     -@ flags
          The flags specified are passed to the debugging macro.
          Debug output is printed to the standard error.

     -w width
          The initial width of the window.  Default:  640.

     -h height
          The initial height of the window.  Default:  480.

OPERANDS
     Commands are read from the file whose name is given as an
     operand.  If no filename is given, commands are read from the
     standard input.

COMMANDS
     When the program begins, a window is created for displaying
     information, which consists of text and geometric objects of
     various kinds.  The project proceeds in two parts:

      (a) Shapes are defined in terms of their sizes (length, width,
          or vertices).

      (b) Objects are drawn in the window by drawing commands, after
          which they may be altered by keyboard commands.

     Sizes, lengths, widths, and coordinates are all floating point
     numbers, and measure pixels.

     Colors may be specified by name using one of the names in the
     file rgb.txt, or by their hexadecimal values in the form
     0xRRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are the red, green, and blue
     components specified as two hexadecimal numbers in the range 00
     to FF.

     The define command makes a record of the definition of an shape
     and makes it available later for a draw command.  The draw
     command creates an object in the screen's object list, to be
     displayed when the program starts.

     The following commands are recognized.  Each command is on a line
     by itself and terminates with the newline character.  If the last
     character on a line is a backslash (\), the command is continued
     onto the next line.

     # ...
          A comment line is ignored, as are empty lines and lines
          consisting only of white space.

     define name text font words...
          A text object is created by concatenating all of the words
          together, each separated from the next by spaces.  The font
          is any of the seven GLUT bitmap fonts:
              Fixed-8x13
              Fixed-9x15
              Helvetica-10
              Helvetica-12
              Helvetica-18
              Times-Roman-10
              Times-Roman-24

     define name ellipse width height
          An ellipse is specified with the major and minor diameters
          specified.  When drawn, the drawing coordinate is the
          center.

     define name circle diameter
          A circle is just an ellipse whose length and width are
          equal.

     define name polygon x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...
          A polygon is specified with the number of vertices being
          equal to the number of $ ( x , y ) $ coordinates given.  The
          polygon must be convex (each interior angle less than 180
          degrees.  The center of the polygon is at $ ( x bar , y bar
          ) $, i.e., at the average of all the $x$ coordinates and the
          average of the $y$ coordinates.  After computing the
          average, it is subtracted from each of the vertices to
          normalize them.  For example, if the vertices are specified
          as shown in the left side of the diagram, they are
          normalized to that shown on the right side, so that $ ( x
          bar , y bar ) $ changes from $ ( .5 , .5 ) $ to $ ( 0 , 0 )
          $.

                    .PS 1i                                                                  .PS 1i
                    "$ ( 0 , 0 ) $" at 0,-.1                                                "$ ( -.5 , -.5 $)" at 0,-.1
                    "$ ( 1 , 0 ) $" at 1,-.1                                                "$ ( +.5 , -.5 $)" at 1,-.1
                    "$ ( 1 , 1 ) $" at 1,1.1                                                "$ ( +.5 , +.5 $)" at 1,1.1
                    "$ ( 0 , 1 ) $" at 0,1.1                                                "$ ( -.5 , +.5 $)" at 0,1.1
                    line from 0,0 to 1,0 then to 1,1 then to 0,1 then to 0,0                line from 0,0 to 1,0 then to 1,1 then to 0,1 then to 0,0
                    "$ ( .5 , .5 ) $" at .5,.5                                              "$ ( 0 , 0 ) $" at .5,.5
                    .PE                                                                     .PE

     define name rectangle width height
          A rectangle with the given width and height is defined with
          strictly horizontal and vertical lines with the given
          thickness.  When drawn, the drawing coordinates will be the
          center.

     define name square width
          A square is a rectangle with equal width and height.

     define name diamond width height
          A diamond's width is from the leftmost to rightmost point
          and its height is from topmost to bottommost height.  The
          draw command specifies its center.

     define name triangle x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2
          A triangle is just another name for a polygon.

     define name right_triangle width height
          Define a right triangle with width the horizontal bar
          extending to the right and height the vertical bar.

     define name isosceles width height
          The width specifies the width of the base, and the height
          specifies the perpendicular distance from the base to the
          apex.

     define name equilateral width
          Makes an isosceles triangle that is also equilateral.

     border color thickness
          Specifies the thickness in pixels of the border surrounding
          the selected object, and its color.  Defaults:  red, 4.

     moveby pixels
          The move parameter indicates how many pixels an object moves
          when directed by one keystroke.  Default:  4.

     draw color name xcenter ycenter
          Draws an object with the center at $ ( x , y ) $ using the
          color specified.

KEYBOARD INPUT
     Once the input file is finished, the keyboard is used to command
     the movements of the objects.  The following keystrokes control
     the program:

     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`Q', `q', Escape      | Close the window.                                       |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`H', `h', Left Arrow  | Move the selected object left.                          |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`J', `j', Down Arrow  | Move the selected object down.                          |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`K', `k', Up Arrow    | Move the selected object up.                            |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`L', `l', Right Arrow | Move the selected object right.                         |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`N', `n', Space, Tab  | Set the selection to the next object.                   |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`P', `p', Backspace   | Set the selection to the previous object.               |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |`0' ... `9'           | Set the selection to objects 0 through 9, respectively. |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     |F1 ... F12            | Set the slection to objects 1 through 12, respectively. |
     +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
     An object is always displayed using the coordinates of the
     center.  If an object is moved off the window, it appears at the
     other end of the window.  That is, if the $x$ or $y$ coordinate
     exceeds the width (height) of the windor, it is set to 0.  If it
     becomes negative, it is set to the width (height).  The selected
     object is always surrounded by a border to make it visible.  For
     objects 0 through 12, the object's number is displayed in the
     center of the object.

EXIT STATUS

     0    No errors were detected.

     1    Errors were detected and messages printed to the standard
          error.

3.  Code

OpenGL and GLUT will be used to display the window.  See the short
example programs in the misc/ subdirectory.  Starter code is in the
code/ subdirectory.  For documentation, Google using the terms
``OpenGL'' and/or ``GLUT'' and the name of the function, then look for
results naming the web pages in www.opengl.org/documentation.
